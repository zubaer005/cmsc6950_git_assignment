Git is a distributed version control system that was created by
Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel


1. Create or edit files.
2. Add the new or changed files to the staging area.
3. Store your changes in the git database, by making a commit.
4. Choose an informative commit message. This helps at a later time to find
   specific commits and to understand the intention of the changes.
5. Continue at step 1. 


Unlike centralized version control systems, Git users can commit new changes,
without the need of an internet connection. They can offline and then later
push batches of commits at once to a server - like GitHub or Bitbucket.
